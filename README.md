That repository contains some of my p5 projects. Trying, testing things... :)

They, actually, all use the library https://p5js.org/.


I firstly wanted to do all these things with p5py, but sadly, this was really slow...

Of course, most (all ?) of these projects are not optimized, and are probably just a start point.  
So if you think it might be improved, feel free to PR :) As it, I could learn again :D

## List

### Hyperspace-visual

My very first project, using a custom Star class.  
Some stars are generated, placed randomly, then depending the mouse X position, the Z-speed will change slower or faster, or even be backwarded :)

[ Demo coming soon... ]
